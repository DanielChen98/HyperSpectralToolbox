HyperSpectralToolbox
====================

The open source Matlab Hyperspectral Toolbox is a matlab toolbox containing various hyperspectral exploitation algorithms. The toolbox is meant to be a concise repository of current state-of-the-art exploitation algorithms for learning and research purposes. The toolbox (will) include(s) functions for:
- Target detection
- Material abundance map (MAM) generation
- Spectral unmixing
- Automated processing
- Change detection
- Visualization
- Reading / writing files (.rfl, .asd, ect)
